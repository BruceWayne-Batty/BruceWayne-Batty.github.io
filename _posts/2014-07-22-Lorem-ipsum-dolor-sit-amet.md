# Why I picked Jekyll over Hexo, VitePress, and WordPress

I’ve been wanting to start a personal blog for a while, and like any good developer, I spent way too much time picking the tool instead of just writing. I tried out four popular options—Hexo, VitePress, WordPress, and Jekyll—and ended up going with Jekyll. Here’s why.

## Quick thoughts on each

**Hexo** is fast and has tons of themes, but it’s very Node.js-focused. If you’re comfortable with JavaScript and want something modern and quick, it’s solid. But for me, setting up plugins and customizing themes started to feel like work.

**VitePress** is super fast and great for docs. If you’re making a project wiki or technical documentation, it’s awesome. But it’s pretty opinionated and feels more like a tool for documentation than a personal blog.

**WordPress** is the giant everyone knows. It’s powerful and user-friendly, but it’s also heavy. If you’re not planning to use it as a full CMS, it feels like overkill. And if you’re exporting it statically, you lose some of what makes WordPress great.

**Jekyll** is the quiet, steady option. It’s been around forever, it’s simple, and it just works.

## Why Jekyll won me over

1. **It works seamlessly with GitHub Pages**
   This was the biggest draw. I already use GitHub for my projects, and GitHub Pages has built-in support for Jekyll. That means I can write a post, push it to my repo, and it’s live—no extra hosting, no build configs, no CI/CD setup. It’s free and it just works.

2. **It’s straightforward**
   There’s not much magic. Posts go in a `_posts` folder, written in Markdown. Layouts are HTML with Liquid tags. Configuration is a simple YAML file. When something doesn’t work, it’s usually easy to figure out why.

3. **It’s content-first**
   Jekyll gets out of the way so I can focus on writing. I don’t have to think about databases, plugins, or complex setups. I write in Markdown, add some front matter, and that’s it.

4. **It’s stable**
   Jekyll isn’t the flashiest tool out there, but it’s reliable. It’s been around for years, and it’s not going anywhere. I don’t want to rebuild my blog every time a new framework comes out.

5. **It plays nice with Mac**
   Setting up Jekyll on a Mac is simple—Ruby comes pre-installed, so it’s just a few terminal commands to get going. I didn’t have to wrestle with installers or compatibility issues.

## Would I recommend it to you?

It depends.

If you love JavaScript and want something fast and modern, check out Hexo. If you’re building docs, VitePress is great. If you want a full CMS with a GUI, WordPress is still king.

But if you want something simple, reliable, and easy to host for free—especially if you’re already on GitHub and using a Mac—give Jekyll a look. It might not be the trendiest choice, but it gets the job done without getting in the way.

In the end, I realized that the best tool is the one that lets you write instead of tinkering. For me, that’s Jekyll.
