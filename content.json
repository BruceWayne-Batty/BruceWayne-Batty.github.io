The picture is provided by the professor and the requirement was to design a one-page relax game design document using the picture provided. The theme of the game is not limited.

This is a deck-building game like slay-spire, but in this game the player will not build a deck. Instead, the player will have to upgarde their own dice to fight the final boss. It’s the player’s choice to be gressive or steady. In this first stage, I tried to build a basic UI system and a UI manager for the game.","categories":[{"name":"Game Developement","slug":"Game-Developement","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Game-Developement/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Dice&Dice","slug":"Dice-Dice","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/Dice-Dice/"},{"name":"GameDesign","slug":"GameDesign","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/GameDesign/"},{"name":"UI","slug":"UI","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/UI/"}]},{"title":"The Price Of Doubting","slug":"The-Price-Of-Doubting","date":"2022-11-29T22:55:52.000Z","updated":"2022-11-29T23:29:57.372Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/11/29/The-Price-Of-Doubting/","link":"","permalink":"http://example.com/2022/11/29/The-Price-Of-Doubting/","excerpt":"","text":"As I’m busy with preparation of my project, I forced myself to read some articles to understand some basic knowledge in the corresponding field. Besides, I also read the white-book of some related projects. For some of the project, I ddi’t really believe what they said in the white-book, so I began to doubt the reliability of these projects, and that costed me a lot of time. Therefore, I began to think why doubting costs so many time, while believing cost nothing? To answer this question, I’ve reorganised the whole process of “doubting”.First, any kind of statement is consist of three parts: Theory&#x2F;Exprience&#x2F;Rule Evidence&#x2F;Facts&#x2F;Supporting Resource Conclusion And the doubting, can aim at 1 or 2, or even the logic of the reasoning process. To doubt part 1 and 2, it can take a lot of time on finding opposite evidence, or just to prove the exist ones are wrong. As for the reasoning process, it is so hard to realize the problem it after you read it. Therefore, the price of doubting is quite high in total.","categories":[{"name":"Daily Bin","slug":"Daily-Bin","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Daily-Bin/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Emotional&Rational Thinking","slug":"Emotional-Rational-Thinking","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/Emotional-Rational-Thinking/"},{"name":"Logic","slug":"Logic","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/Logic/"}]},{"title":"First Thing First: 404 not fine","slug":"First-Thing-First-404-not-fine","date":"2022-11-27T17:49:22.000Z","updated":"2022-11-27T17:50:10.945Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/11/27/First-Thing-First-404-not-fine/","link":"","permalink":"http://example.com/2022/11/27/First-Thing-First-404-not-fine/","excerpt":"","text":"At first, this page is only for testing if the website works. However, when I finished all of settings on this page, I started to think about the problem of testing. Why do we need to test things? Or the question is, how do we comfort oursleves after we finish our job? I observed many people’s coding process, and I think they can be divided into 3 categories. Cautious DebuggerThis kind of people try to test every new character they add in the code, even if they add a comment line in the program, they will run the program to test if that line is in the comment mode. Functional TesterFor this kind, they will only test the functionality of each part, and sometimes they will have bugs of typo or similar problems. If you try to read their code, you can understand the functions and variable clearly. The only problem is I never see this kind of people in reality. Confident conquerorThe condident conqueror, also known as “Conqueror The XXX”. The coding level of this group varies a lot. Some of them are like a bug generating machine. If you keep compiling their code everyday, you will definitly become a master of recognizing errors and detecting bugs. In the meanwhile, some of them are like the skynet of The Terminator, and the only thing you need to worry about them is building a killing machine in one day. The most interesting thing about this testing process is that I have taken a course about this process, but now the only piece of memory of this course I have, is having hotpot after the exam, and it tastes really good to have it, even in the summer. So, to redeem my memory, I searched “How to “How to test your code formally”. The result really surprised me. In short, you should do either like group1 or group2, but not group3. I think the most possible reason is that none of the people I know, who is good at coding, is working in a huge group, so they don’t need to care about the readability of the code, but only the functionality. I think this is enough for “testing”, both for testing all kinds of functions and for this topic.","categories":[{"name":"Test_categories","slug":"Test-categories","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Test-categories/"}],"tags":[{"name":"test","slug":"test","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/test/"},{"name":"test2","slug":"test2","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/test2/"}]}],"categories":[{"name":"Game Design","slug":"Game-Design","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Game-Design/"},{"name":"Game Developement","slug":"Game-Developement","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Game-Developement/"},{"name":"Daily Bin","slug":"Daily-Bin","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Daily-Bin/"},{"name":"Test_categories","slug":"Test-categories","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Test-categories/"}],"tags":[{"name":"GameDesign","slug":"GameDesign","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/GameDesign/"},{"name":"GDD","slug":"GDD","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/GDD/"},{"name":"Dice&Dice","slug":"Dice-Dice","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/Dice-Dice/"},{"name":"UI","slug":"UI","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/UI/"},{"name":"Emotional&Rational Thinking","slug":"Emotional-Rational-Thinking","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/Emotional-Rational-Thinking/"},{"name":"Logic","slug":"Logic","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/Logic/"},{"name":"test","slug":"test","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/test/"},{"name":"test2","slug":"test2","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/test2/"}]}
