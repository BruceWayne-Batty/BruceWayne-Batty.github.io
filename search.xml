    <title>First Thing First: 404 not fine</title>
    <url>/2022/11/27/First-Thing-First-404-not-fine/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>At first, this page is only for testing if the website works. However, when I finished all of settings on this page, I started to think about the problem of testing.</p>
<p>Why do we need to test things? Or the question is, how do we comfort oursleves after we finish our job? I observed many people’s coding process, and I think they can be divided into 3 categories.</p>
<ol>
<li>Cautious Debugger<br>This kind of people try to test every new character they add in the code, even if they add a comment line in the program, they will run the program to test if that line is in the comment mode.</li>
<li>Functional Tester<br>For this kind, they will only test the functionality of each part, and sometimes they will have bugs of typo or similar problems. If you try to read their code, you can understand the functions and variable clearly. The only problem is I never see this kind of people in reality.</li>
<li>Confident conqueror<br>The condident conqueror, also known as “Conqueror The XXX”.  The coding level of this group varies a lot. Some of them are like a bug generating machine. If you keep compiling their code everyday, you will definitly become a master of recognizing errors and detecting bugs. In the meanwhile, some of them are like the skynet of The Terminator, and the only thing you need to worry about them is building a killing machine in one day.</li>
</ol>
<p>The most interesting thing about this testing process is that I have taken a course about this process, but now the only piece of memory of this course I have, is having hotpot after the exam, and it tastes really good to have it, even in the summer. So, to redeem my memory, I searched “How to “How to test your code formally”. The result really surprised me. In short, you should do either like group1 or group2, but not group3. I think the most possible reason is that none of the people I know, who is good at coding, is working in a huge group, so they don’t need to care about the readability of the code, but only the functionality. </p>
<p>I think this is enough for “testing”, both for testing all kinds of functions and for this topic. </p>

    <title>The Price Of Doubting</title>
    <url>/2022/11/29/The-Price-Of-Doubting/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>As I’m busy with preparation of my project, I forced myself to read some articles to understand some basic knowledge in the corresponding field. Besides, I also read the white-book of some related projects. For some of the project, I ddi’t really believe what they said in the white-book, so I began to doubt the reliability of these projects, and that costed me a lot of time. Therefore, I began to think why doubting costs so many time, while believing cost nothing? To answer this question, I’ve reorganised the whole process of “doubting”.<br>First, any kind of statement is consist of three parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Theory&#x2F;Exprience&#x2F;Rule</li>
<li>Evidence&#x2F;Facts&#x2F;Supporting Resource</li>
<li>Conclusion</li>
</ol>
<p>And the doubting, can aim at 1 or 2, or even the logic of the reasoning process. To doubt part 1 and 2, it can take a lot of time on finding opposite evidence, or just to prove the exist ones are wrong. As for the reasoning process, it is so hard to realize the problem it after you read it. Therefore, the price of doubting is quite high in total. </p>

    <title>Developing of Dice&amp;Dice 0:Create Basic UI manager</title>
    <url>/2023/01/29/Developing-of-Dice-Dice-0-Create-Basic-UI-manager/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>After 1 month of preparing, I decided to start the development of this game I planed to do so long ago. This is a deck-building game like slay-spire, but in this game the player will not build a deck. Instead, the player will have to upgarde their own dice to fight the final boss. It’s the player’s choice to be gressive or steady. In this first stage, I tried to build a basic UI system and a UI manager for the game.

    <title>GDD for Fluffy&amp;Fury</title>
    <url>/2023/03/20/GDD-for-Fluffy-Fury/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Actually this GDD file is an assignment of the course I take in the course narrative game design. The picture is provided by the professor and the requirement was to design a one-page relax game design document using the picture provided. The theme of the game is not limited. Therefore, I came up with this idea of traveling game, in which you can travel with your giant fluffy friend and enjoy the immersive feeling along the way. Click the link to see the file.</p>

    <title>二次元手游归一性</title>
    <url>/2023/03/23/%E4%BA%8C%E6%AC%A1%E5%85%83%E6%89%8B%E6%B8%B8%E5%BD%92%E4%B8%80%E6%80%A7/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>何谓二游归一性，这其实是我自创的一个名词，形容的是二次元手游在玩家群体稳定之后，游戏模式变得同质化和单一化这个现象。</p>
<p>我本身并不是什么二游重度玩家，玩过的大部分二游也仅仅是止步于度过新手期开始长草，抄作业，一旦涉及到排名和竞速之后最高也就在前5%的区间。虽然每个游戏的深度止步于核心玩家之前，但是基本上所有类型的二游我都或多或少的玩过。那么，既然说所有类型，就表明有类型之分，那又何来的归一化之说呢？</p>
<p>现在二游的一个普遍设计思路是抢占玩家的碎片化时间。这也是我下来所体会到的，所有的二游都是在新手开荒期会有很多可以肝的点，比如说有可以新的副本，有新的模式，或者说有没有打完的主线，而在打主线的过程中拿到的收益又会解锁更多的新模式。这个阶段我称之为“可肝阶段”。一般来说，这个阶段的持续时间在一到两周，具体视入坑时间和玩家的肝度来决定。在经历这个阶段之后，就会开始平稳发育期，这个时期的玩家每天刷到的非抽卡资源都还能有用，但是由于体力限制或者收益限制，每天能获取的资源有限，在逐渐把所有可以靠资源提升的内容升级完之后，就会进入长草期（也有很多玩家会在平稳发育期就开始长草，因为总会有许多角色是没有培养潜力的，也就是说角色本身的强度太低，或者对应的体系还没有成型，导致玩家没有培养这个角色的欲望）。在长草期的一个普遍特点就是，刷到的资源没地方用，或者说在出新的角色或活动之前，都没有继续刷的动力。基本上每天就是上线做完日常。而二游的归一性就体现在这里，试想一下，任何一个正在玩的二游，把每日任务的内容换到一个你没有玩过的游戏里面，我相信大多数玩家都不会愿意做这个任务。</p>
<p>从这个角度出发，我认为二游的专注点应该是在“可肝阶段”尽可能的吸引玩家，让玩家在平稳发育期也能有足够多的游戏内容。这又涉及到我的另一个观点，二游不应该有过多的游戏性和复杂的机制，只需要简单的吸引玩家然后让玩家每天做日常上班就好了。（悲）</p>

    <title>Development Blog 0</title>
    <url>/2023/03/27/Individual-Devlopment-Log-0/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>This is the devlopment blog for the first week. We are a group of 5 people, with 3 of us(including me) from IMT(Interactive media technology) and 2 of us from CS(computer science). We hold 3 meetings last week.</p>
<p>In the first meeting, we created a discord group and introduced our own game experience and interests. And each of us posted some ideas for the second meeting.</p>
<p>In the second meeting, we created a Github repositories for the project and created a file for brainstorming.<br><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GQv7rel7Mu2gYWMWDtnZ0I2Jze_WZif6btxeDMt9PNw/edit?usp=sharing">Link for the ranking file</a><br>We listed 16 different game types(from the games we played before), and each group member ranked it using scale from 1-5 to decided which type of the game we will make.</p>
<p>In the third meeting, we chose 3 winner from the types, which are “Top down action RPG”, “Risk of rain like game” and “Deck building game rougelike”. we settled on a top down action 2d  isometric game with a sort of apocalyptic theme. Jesper really wanted to work on some procedural generation so we might do that for levels. We also wrote down some more ideas in the brainstorm spreadsheet for the player character and weapons and such.</p>
<p>Laila came up with an idea involving the apocalyptic theme: The enemies are humanoid cyborgs with enhanced strength, speed and powers. Animal cyborgs are also an idea for example cyborg wolves that are more aggressive or birds that can fly. The setting could be a post-apocalyptic world (cities). The cyborgs could be part of an old army controlled by humans but that have turned against them. Below are some images generating using NovelAI base on the above description.<br><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/03/28/bpZmxH5Ac2TWCRe.jpg" alt="Character1.jpg"><br><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/03/28/aKFzLfeN6GmU4B1.jpg" alt="Character2.jpg"><br><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/03/28/zuiweNdJ3qxmUhI.jpg" alt="Character3.jpg"><br><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/03/28/2KOAyGI78plnTbv.png" alt="Character4.png"></p>
<p>Inspired by this idea, I elaborated a little bit more on it and gave some general ideas of our character and enemy design: The characters can upgrade using parts of the cyborgs they defeat. And the idea of just picking some gears is way too normal, so I’m thinking if we can design the character to be some a universal model cyborgs. And when defeat the enemy, the player can just rip some parts of the enemy and directly use it as an upgrade. Following with this design, we can also make the player choose between differnet start universal model.</p>
<p>I’m reading a relative Call of Cthulhu module to get more inspiration for the theme. The name of the module is “Section M”.</p>

    <title>Development Blog 1</title>
    <url>/2023/04/03/Development-Blog-1/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>This is the devlopment blog for game <em>“TechnoScourge: Rise of the Adaptivethe”</em> second week. Two meetings and several online discussion were conducted.</p>
<p>For the first meeting, we focus on our game pitch. Vine drew the icon for the game and generated some other images of board setting using midjourney to choose which type of map we want to work on.<br><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/04/03/I7keMlAFvH68Lfd.png" alt="Icon.png"></p>
<p>In the second meeting, we set up the milestone for each stage of the development, I choose to take part of the stat of the game.</p>
<p>For the discussion, we have some detail ideas about the story and mechanic of the game. Since the player will have a lot of freedom to make their own cyborgs, we want to make the player’s cyborg as the final boss for the next round(We plan to make the final boss has two stages, and the stage one will be the player in the last round).</p>
<p>I wrote a background story for the game, and this is the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WuSVeZoLFCaIVYwqEQjWVoeXny_jd7Ie/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=102567030602020784812&rtpof=true&sd=true">link to the story</a></p>
<p>When using the unity projects shared by Jesper, we encountered a problem of missing some prefab file, and the problem is solved by intalling blender and set blender as the default open method for the .blend file. After solving the problem, we used that project as the base to develope our game</p>
<p>I created an object type to store all kinds of data, now it only includes character data. The stats of enemy and inventory  will be added later using the same type of object. Another script is created to fetch the data. I’ve tested  fetching the speed in the player movement script and it works well.  I committed the change to branch”Bruce”. I “accidentally” learned how to make the function of saving and loading data in the process of learning how to deal with data in the unity, so I will implement that later.</p>
<p>David said that We have an issue with the way the repository is structed right now. The .gitignore should ignore &#x2F;Library&#x2F;, but since the test project was placed in a subfolder &#x2F;orthographics_test&#x2F; it was commited anyway. So we should fix that problem in our next meeting.</p>
